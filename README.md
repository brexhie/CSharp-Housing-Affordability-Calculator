# CSharp-Housing-Affordability-Calculator-
A C# console application which helps you calculate if you can afford to rent or buy property.

Upon running the program, the user is met with a single line of text prompting them to enter their 
gross income.
If the user does not enter a number, an error message displays and the program ends. This happens 
everywhere where a user has to input a value.
If the user does enter a number, the program continues. It asks the user to enter their estimated
monthly tax deductions, expenditure on housing, transportation, insurance, medical and health care, 
saving, investing and debt payments.
The user is asked to choose between renting accommodation or buying property.
If the user chooses to rent, then they must enter the rental amount for the accommodation.
If the rental amount is less than the user’s gross income divided by 3, then the program displays that
they can afford the accommodation. It also displays the amount of money that the user has left after 
all their deductions.
If the rental amount is more than the user’s gross income divided by 3, the program displays that 
they cannot afford the accommodation and displays the amount of money the user has left after all 
their deductions.
If the user chooses to buy property, they are asked to enter the total cost of the property, their total 
deposit, the interest rate on the property and the duration of the home loan in months.
A calculation is done to determine the monthly loan repayment cost, and if the monthly loan 
repayment is less than the user’s gross income divided by 3, the program displays that they can
afford the property and displays the amount of money they have left after all their deductions.
If the monthly loan repayment is greater than the user’s gross income divided by 3, the program 
displays that they cannot afford the property and displays the amount of money they have left after 
all their deductions.
